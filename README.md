**Simple Compiler with Login GUI (Java Swing)
**

This project is a Java-based GUI application that simulates a simple compiler for evaluating arithmetic expressions ‚Äî but with a twist:
you must log in first to access the compiler window! üîê

The project is built using Java Swing for the GUI and implements basic compiler-like functionalities, such as syntax checking and expression evaluation, for arithmetic operations.

Features
Login Authentication:
Basic login page with username and password validation (default: admin / 1234).

Expression Evaluation:
Supports arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, and parentheses ( ).

Syntax Checking:
Detects syntax errors before attempting to evaluate the expression.

Clear Functionality:
Allows resetting input and output fields easily.

User-Friendly Interface:
Built entirely using Java Swing with a simple and clean layout.
